Introducing Algernon, an experiment in reinforcement learning to show how a mouse pointer can be curious. No extrinsic motivation needed!

# Warnings
GPU needed!

# Decision
In my best interest, Algernon v2.0 will be closed-source, and will continue to be closed-source until it is ready. Thank you.
